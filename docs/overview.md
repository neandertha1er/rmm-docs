# What is Primitive?

Several projects fall under the Primitive name: a US equity company Primitive Bits, the decentralized protocol Primitive Protocol, and the Primitive Interface. 

**Company:** The company is a US incorporated legal entity that develops the protocol and interface.

**Protocol:** The protocol is a set of immutable smart contracts which do not grant special permission to the Company.

**Interface: **The interface is open-source code hosted on a company controlled domain [primitive.finance](https://primitive.finance), as well as decentrally hosted through [IPFS](https://ipfs.io). It is available to be downloaded and run locally.

### Overview

The Primitive Protocol is a series of specialized liquidity pools. 

Primitive's pools are designed to [statically replicate a target portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicating_portfolio), while generating fees for the liquidity providers and acting as a venue for traders to swap between the assets of the pools.

The use of the protocol is open to all and controlled by none. There is no ability to censor who interacts with the Protocol. As such, assets cannot be removed from the protocol, or [restricted from being traded](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-interactive-brokers-restrict-trading-in-gamestop-s.html).
