# What is Primitive?

Several projects fall under the Primitive name: a US equity company Primitive Bits, the decentralized protocol Primitive, and the Primitive Interface.

**Company:** The company is a US incorporated legal entity that develops and contributes to the protocol and interface.

**Protocol:** The protocol is a set of immutable smart contracts with no admin key power.

**Interface:** The interface is open-source code hosted on a company controlled domain [primitive.finance](https://primitive.finance), as well as decentrally hosted through [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/). It is available to be downloaded and run locally.

## Overview

Primitive the protocol is a peer-to-peer system for exchanging _option payoffs_. Anyone can use the Primitive smart contracts to supply ERC-20 tokens and receive a position with an option payoff of their choice. Unlike traditional systems, these positions are instantly convertible into the value of these payoffs at all points in time.

The use of the protocol is open to all, with no ability to censor who interacts with it. Options cannot be removed from the protocol, or [restricted from being traded](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-interactive-brokers-restrict-trading-in-gamestop-s.html).
